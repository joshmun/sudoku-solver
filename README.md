*Figure 1*.  Animation solving a sudoku puzzle and partially verifying the solution.

[Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes") contains the digits from 1 to 9.

By the end of this challenge we'll have a fully functioning Sudoku solver that runs from the command line.  We'll be presented with 15 unsolved Sudoku puzzles.  The puzzles can be found in the file `sudoku_puzzles.txt`.

 * Five puzzles can be solved with **basic logic**.
 * Five require slightly more **advanced logic**.
 * Five require **educated guessing**.

A complete solution to this challenge will solve all 15 puzzles.
